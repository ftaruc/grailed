About the size 11 box: this is, to the best of my knowledge, the box this pair was originally sold in. As you can see, the box is for a size 11. But also, as you can see, it's definitely a box from 1985. This pair is from a Sotheby's NY auction from summer 2020 called Peter Moore lot, the subsequent auction in the same year contained 1986 pairs instead for the Bred.
Currently stored in a safe semi-dry and cool environment to preserve them as much as possible and it would be shipped the same way.
I doubt you will find a pair in better condition than this, or any other deadstock pair specifically from 1985 for that matter. I am in no hurry, but these are a piece of history of basketball, sneaker, fashion and design culture. Designed by Peter Moore for Michael Jordan himself, this shoe would not only begin a revolution, but it also started by being banned by the NBA because of its color scheme not containing the approved team colors.
Nike used this to create a campaign around the shoe as the ""Banned"" Jordan 1s.
This is the Nike ad:

1985 Sky Jordan 1 High “Chicago”
Designed in the same year as the original Nike Air Jordan 1, the 'Sky' Jordan 1 was the junior line's response to the limited technology resources available in 1985. Nike were unable to develop an air unit in the mid-sole of a junior shoe as it was simply too small and so the Sky Jordan took form.
Far fewer units of the Sky Jordan 1 were produced than the Air Jordan 1, making this important design rarer than the iconic Air Jordan

But please understand that they’re vintage. Little bit of sole separation but nothing noticeable. They’re VERY WELL held together by the threads, they will not fall apart, trust me.
Please refer to the pictures attached!
Please ask any questions about condition, I will happily answer!
But overall:
Extremely hard to come by a pair in this condition.

The shoe and its history speak for themselves. Condition is wearable, but collars are thin and crunchy, heel is crumbly, they are generally uncomfortable. It’s a fashion before function decision to wear these. These come only with what is pictured, but both the laces and insoles are original. This means no box or spare lace set. Aside from obvious aesthetic wear on the paint the soles and heel drag is not too bad. Obviously iconic and incredible pair of shoes to see, let alone own. Judge condition based off of what I’ve stated and pictures, they will come as shown.

Light yellowing due to Virgil being an idiot and not using proper materials on the toe box (this will occur with any pair and can also be seen on DS pairs.)

Enjoyed The Last Dance documentary? I know I did! You can enjoy it even more with a vintage 1985 pair of Jordan 1s.
These are a beautifully-aged, well-worn pair of 1985 Jordan 1s in the color way, Chicago/ Black-Red-white, Size 10.5. Because of the thicker leather used in these pairs and the 35 years that have passed, they tend to fit half a size smaller.
This was the shoe that started it all and is highly coveted by sneakerheads and collectors all over the universe.
This pair is 35 years old and you can definitely see the wear and tear it has taken over the years. Pictured are the creases, scuffs, and oxidized yellow midsoles which add to the amazing vintage worn-in look that many shoes today try to mimic (i.e. Union 1s, Travis Scott 1s, RHUDE shoes).
To my knowledge, these are OG laces and insoles. However, the red Nike Air logo on the insoles have faded completely due to wear. You can see parts of the manufacturing code in white print on the shoes. I believe it reads 10 1/2, 850507, TY1 (Size / Date Produced / Factory ID Code).
Collars have paint chipping as pictured. In regards to collar foam padding, the foam has hardened/stiffened in the both shoes for the most part and has crumbling towards the top half. There are small areas of softness towards the bottom. Outsoles have lost most of the star count and have some heel drag towards the back. The rubber outsoles are still malleable in some areas but feel stiffer towards the toe area (where the balls of the feet and toes would be ). I have not personally worn these and do not plan to wear them to test out wearability. These have been kept as a collector's piece on display. Otherwise, there have been no shoe cobbler modifications to the shoe. Leather has not been repainted.
These are being listed as an awesome collectors piece and not a wearable shoe to flex at your next party once quarantine is over. These could be used for a restoration project! They are a piece of history that will turn heads. I will ship these with shipping insurance via the carrier so that the shipment goes smoothly. I will also be documenting the shipping process to ensure that the item is shipped as described by this post! I recently sold two 1985 pairs on grailed that went smoothly.
Please feel free to message me with questions or offers. Unfortunately no OG box or other laces.

If you have any LEGITIMATE questions, FOR INFORMATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN ALREADY COVERED IN THE DESCRIPTION, please contact me before purchasing the item. IF YOU ASK ME A QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN ALREADY COVERED IN THE DESCRIPTION, IF YOU SEND ME ANY OFFER, YOU WILL BE BLOCKED FROM VIEWING AND PURCHASING ANY OF MY ITEMS FOR SALE.

Up for sale is one pair 100% AUTHENTIC GENTLY USED ORIGINAL 1985 AIR JORDAN 1 in White/Black-Red a.k.a. ""Chicago"" colorway in a men's US size 8.5. Model code 4280. I used the 1994 retro model code in the listing for Grailed would not accept the ORIGINAL model code in the listing.
As seen in the ESPN 10 part documentary ""The Last Dance"". Michael ""Air"" Jordan wore an original deadstock pair from his personal collection in honor of his last game as a member of the NBA Champions Chicago Bulls in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks in 1998. Fact, the shoes were A SIZE SMALLER than what he normally wore at that time, thus why his feet were not only sore but, bleeding during and after the game. I am actually surprised the shoe held up during use.
The shoes are in a GENTLY USED condition. I am the SECOND owner. I NEVER wore the shoes. I NEVER even attempted to try on the shoes. Original laces and insoles. The ""Nike Air"" logos on the insoles of the shoe are visible and mostly intact. NO original box or shoe accessories. A replacement box will be provided for shipping. Please see the accompanying pictures for overall condition of the shoes.
The shoes have NOT been repaired, repainted, or restored in any way, shape, or form.
These shoes ARE A COLLECTOR'S PIECE ONLY. The shoes are 35 YEARS OLD. THE SHOES ARE NOT WEARABLE. QUESTIONS ABOUT SIZE OR WHETHER THEY ARE FOR ANY TYPE OF USE WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.
SERIOUS COLLECTORS ONLY.
I have been collecting shoes since 1991. My member ID on that other major reselling website is ""airjordanjumpman23"" with 100% positive feedback. I have been a member on that site since 1999.
The shoes come from a pet free and smoke free household and have been stored in a temperature controlled environment.

Been enjoying the Last Dance? I know I have! You can enjoy them even more in a vintage 1985 pair of Jordan 1s.
These are a beautifully-aged pair of 1985 Jordan 1s in the color way, Chicago/ Black-Red-white, Size 11. Because of the thicker leather used in these pairs and the 35 years that have passed, they tend to fit half a size smaller. (Fits size 10.5/11)
This was the shoe that started it all and is highly coveted by sneakerheads and collectors all over the universe.
1985 Jordan 1s have stood the test of time because of the thicker cut of real leather and the rubber soles that factories used before. Rubber soles do not fall victim to crumbling over time like other Jordan models that have polyurethane midsoles. The shape and construction of the 1985 OG pairs are unmatched by retros. There is a sleekness to the toebox shape and a straightness to the heel, rather than the curve seen on retro pairs.
This pair is 35 years old and you can definitely see the wear and tear it has taken over the years. Pictured are the creases, scuffs, and oxidized yellow midsoles which add to the amazing vintage worn-in look that many shoes today try to mimic (i.e. Union 1s, Travis Scott 1s, RHUDE shoes).
These shoes are 100% authentic with OG laces and OG insoles. However, the red Nike Air logo on the insoles have faded completely due to wear. You can see the manufacturing code on only the left shoe, as the right shoe's white print has faded. It reads 11 850406 TY1. (Size / Date Produced / Factory ID Code).
Collars have paint chipping, but have held up pretty well for their age. In regards to collar foam padding, the foam has hardened in the right shoe and has crumbling towards the top half. The left is stiff at the bottom but still is softer in middle areas. Left shoe padding has begun to crumble, but not as much as the right shoe. Outsoles have lost a lot of the star count and have some heel drag, but are still flexible and not cracked/stiff. Otherwise, there have been no shoe cobbler modifications to the shoe. Leather has not been repainted. These shoes are still wearable, but they are not as comfortable as a modern Jordan because of the stiff foam areas.
Definitely a collectors piece that will turn heads. They are a piece of history.
Please feel free to message me with questions or offers. Unfortunately no OG box or other laces.

Excellent condition throughout considering their age. Absolutely wearable. But obviously wouldn’t play ball in them.
They are a collectors item and being sold as such. So wear at your own risk. I put sole protectors on them to conserve the original soles and it worked wonderfully. I have since removed the sole protectors to take these photos.
Very little to no crunch in the collars. Only real wear on them is on the leather collars. Typical for some OG 1’s. But not so bad that they’re an eye sore.

Shoe Characteristics:
1985 Nike Air Jordan 1 (Chicago) Banned Sz 11 TY Vintage OG. Condition is Pre-Owned and Worn when released in the 80's. This shoe is 34 years old and is the start of it all! It was the most expensive basketball shoe of its time at $65.00/pair. These have been in my family since 1985. There are no returns. I will record the shipping of the sneakers to ensure that scammers cannot scam. Very minor yellowing appearing on the mid sole due to age but mostly off white. This is some wonderful wear on the leather throughout. Toe box has minor defects. Replacement laces, and OG soles. The leather is very flexible making it extremely wearable! The black leather collars have worn away. However, there are still hints of black left giving it some character. The shoes do not come with the original box as the box could not be salvaged after being in the closet for so many years. The soles are red all the way through and have no white bone showing. There is a little heel drag but nothing too drastic in my opinion. Overall, this is a very clean shoe. NOTHING HAS BEEN ALTERED ON THE SHOE (Such as re-paints, or restorations of any sort). As Stock as it gets. Vintage is were its at. Most new Jordans will not last this long as the genuine leather and rubber used in production on the 1985s were made of much higher quality! You be the judge. Don't miss out on an opportunity to own a part of history. Free shipping to the US.

Immaculate condition! It’s very hard to come by a pair this clean with original box and retro card.
100% stars; Nike Air logo still intact on both insoles
The only flaw is minor sole separation, but that’s an easy fix. Still very wearable. Midsoles are very firm.
