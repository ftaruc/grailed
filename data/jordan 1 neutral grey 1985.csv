Cheaper alternative to those neutral grey 1â€™s!
These vintage shoes are in super crazy condition for being 30+ years old. There is minimal wear on them, with the soles being fully intact and fully wearable. Thereâ€™s not a lot of yellowing and the only flaws are a few dirt marks and one of the lace holes is cut(look at last photo), but if you wrap the laces around the back it should be no problem!
*Iâ€™ll clean the dirt off the shoes before sending!
Tagged as a womenâ€™s size 10 and fit me perfectly! I wear an 8.5-9 in other Nikes and Vans!
