These were taken to a cobbler/shoe repairman before working on Jordans/customs was common. The guy really messed them up trying to reinforce everything. There's random stitching, painting, cushioning, and hardening throughout the top portion, please refer to the detailed pictures for reference on the condition. Despite this, these are still very much wearable.

Extremely rare item:
1985 Sky Jordan 1 High ‚ÄúChicago‚Äù
Designed in the same year as the original Nike Air Jordan 1, the 'Sky' Jordan 1 was the junior line's response to the limited technology resources available in 1985. Nike were unable to develop an air unit in the mid-sole of a junior shoe as it was simply too small and so the Sky Jordan took form.
Far fewer units of the Sky Jordan 1 were produced than the Air Jordan 1, making this important design rarer than the iconic Air Jordan
